# CAPSTONE-PROJECT-CUSTOMER-CHURN
# Customer Churn Prediction - README

## **Project Overview**
Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry, leading to significant revenue loss. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models, enabling businesses to proactively retain at-risk customers through targeted interventions. By analyzing key customer attributes and service usage, we developed a robust predictive model that helps businesses improve customer retention strategies.

## **Objectives**
- **Predict customer churn** based on historical telecom data.
- **Identify key factors** that influence churn behavior.
- **Optimize model performance** to maximize recall (minimizing false negatives).
- **Provide actionable insights** to reduce customer attrition.

---

## **Steps Taken**
### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Loaded the **Customer Churn dataset**.
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric format to ensure correct data handling.
- Encoded categorical features (e.g., `Contract`, `PaymentMethod`) into numerical values.
- Scaled numerical variables (`tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`) using **StandardScaler** for model efficiency.
- **Split the dataset** into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

### **2. Model Selection & Training**
- Implemented **three supervised learning models**:
  - **Logistic Regression** (Baseline Model)
  - **Random Forest Classifier** (Robust, handles feature importance well)
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (Good for high-dimensional data)
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix**.

### **3. Hyperparameter Tuning & Optimization**
- Used **GridSearchCV** to find the best hyperparameters.
- Optimized the models to **maximize recall**, ensuring fewer missed churn cases.

### **4. Model Evaluation & Visualization**
- Plotted **Confusion Matrix** to analyze misclassification.
- Generated **Precision-Recall Curve** to balance false positives & false negatives.
- Created **ROC Curve** to assess model performance.
- Selected the **best-performing model** for deployment.

### **5. Deployment & Business Insights**
- Finalized the most effective model for **real-world churn prediction**.
- Provided **actionable insights** for business decision-makers.
- Recommended strategies to **reduce churn and improve customer loyalty**.

## **Challenges Faced & How We Overcame Them**

1. **Data Quality Issues**
   - The `TotalCharges` column had incorrect data types (stored as strings instead of numeric values).
   - Solution: Converted the column using `pd.to_numeric()` while handling errors.

2. **Handling Categorical Variables**
   - Many categorical features (`Contract`, `PaymentMethod`) needed encoding.
   - Solution: Used **Label Encoding** for multi-class categories and **Binary Mapping** for Yes/No features.

3. **Balancing False Positives & False Negatives**
   - Churn prediction is a **business-critical problem** where missing a churn case (False Negative) is more costly than incorrectly predicting churn (False Positive).
   - Solution: **Prioritized Recall** during model tuning to minimize missed churn cases.

4. **Model Selection & Performance Tuning**
   - Some models performed well on accuracy but failed in detecting actual churners.
   - Solution: **Hyperparameter tuning** and feature selection improved recall and model robustness.

5. **Evaluation Display Errors**
   - Some visualization functions had rendering issues.
   - Solution: Re-ran processes and structured outputs efficiently.

## **Key Takeaways for Management**
- **Churn Prediction Improves Retention**: A well-trained model can **proactively identify** customers likely to leave.
- **Targeted Retention Strategies Work**: Personalized offers and customer service improvements can prevent churn.
- **Data-Driven Decisions Boost Revenue**: Predicting churn reduces customer loss, leading to long-term financial gains.
- **Optimized Recall Ensures Actionability**: Our best model maximizes recall, ensuring minimal missed churn cases.

## **Next Steps & Recommendations**
1. **Deploy the model** for real-time customer churn predictions.
2. **Integrate predictions** into a CRM system for proactive retention efforts.
3. **Expand analysis** by incorporating additional customer behavioral data.
4. **Experiment with advanced models** (XGBoost, Deep Learning) for further improvement.

### ðŸš€ **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting customer churn, helping businesses make informed retention decisions. By implementing data-driven strategies, telecom companies can significantly reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.
